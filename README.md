### Project Overview:
This was mini project in collaboration with fellow students
in Columbia's Deep Learning course. The goal was to implement
a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Numpy and 
TensorFlow low/mid level API to achieve > 72% accuracy on
the Cifar-10 dataset. 

Final Accuracy: 78%
